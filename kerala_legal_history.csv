**SUBJECT: LEGAL NOTICE FOR DEFAMATION AND CLAIM FOR DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF PARTY A**

Sir/Madam,

Under instructions from and on behalf of my esteemed client, **PARTY A**, son/daughter of [FATHER'S NAME/IDENTIFIER], residing at [RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS OF PARTY A], [CITY, PIN CODE], Kerala (hereinafter referred to as ""my client""), I hereby most respectfully serve upon you the following legal notice:

1.  My client, PARTY A, most respectfully showeth that he/she is a highly respected individual/entity in [mention field/community if applicable, e.g., the business community of Alappuzha / a renowned social worker in Kerala / a prominent professional in the medical field], having an impeccable reputation and good standing in society/business circles for the past [NUMBER] years. My client has diligently built a reputation for integrity, honesty, and professional ethics through years of dedicated service/endeavour.

2.  That you, PARTY B, are a resident of [GENERAL LOCATION OF PARTY B] and were aware of my client's unblemished reputation and standing in the community.

3.  That on or about **[DATE OF DEFAMATION, e.g., 15th April 2024]**, at **[PLACE OF DEFAMATION, e.g., a public meeting held at the Alappuzha Municipal Town Hall / during a broadcast on a local news channel 'Alappuzha Today' / through a widely circulated post on the social media platform 'FaceConnect']**, you, with malicious intent and utter disregard for the truth, falsely and maliciously published/uttered/circulated defamatory statements concerning my client, PARTY A.

4.  The specific words/imputations made by you were to the effect that **[REPRODUCE/SUMMARIZE THE DEFAMATORY STATEMENT, e.g., 'PARTY A has embezzled substantial funds from the local charity trust he manages'; 'PARTY A is involved in corrupt practices related to land dealings in Alappuzha'; 'PARTY A is notoriously dishonest and has defrauded numerous individuals in his business ventures']**. These statements were made publicly and were widely disseminated, reaching a significant number of individuals in the community.

5.  My client states that these allegations are utterly false, baseless, vexatious, and were made with the sole intention of maligning my client's spotless reputation and causing severe prejudice to my client's standing in society/business. There is absolutely no truth or basis whatsoever to these malicious imputations, and your actions demonstrate a clear intent to defame and disparage my client.

6.  As a direct consequence of your aforesaid defamatory actions, my client has suffered immense mental agony, severe emotional distress, loss of prestige, and irreparable damage to his/her hard-earned reputation both personally and professionally. My client's good name, built over decades of honest work, has been severely tarnished in the eyes of the public, community members, business associates, and peers. My client has also faced social ostracism and professional setbacks due to your false allegations.

7.  Your aforementioned actions constitute a grave act of defamation under civil law, rendering you liable for substantial damages and other legal consequences.

Under the circumstances, I am instructed by my client to demand, which I hereby do, that you:

a.  Immediately cease and desist from making any further defamatory statements or publications against my client, PARTY A, in any form or through any medium whatsoever.
b.  Tender an unconditional, unequivocal, and written apology to my client, PARTY A, within **[NUMBER, e.g., seven (7)]** days from the receipt of this notice. This apology must be published with the same prominence and through the same medium/media as your original defamatory statements (e.g., in the same local news channel/social media platform/newspaper where the statements were made).
c.  Retract all false and defamatory statements made by you against my client, PARTY A, forthwith.
d.  Pay a sum of **Rs. [AMOUNT, e.g., 1,00,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Only)]** to my client as compensation for the immense damage caused to my client's reputation, mental agony, loss of standing, and professional harm, within **[NUMBER, e.g., seven (7)]** days from the receipt of this notice.

PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that if you fail to comply with the aforesaid demands within the stipulated period, my client shall be constrained to initiate appropriate civil and/or criminal legal proceedings against you for defamation, claiming substantial damages, permanent injunctions, and other reliefs as may be advised, entirely at your risk as to cost and consequences, without any further reference to you.

A copy of this notice is kept in my office for record and future reference.

Yours faithfully,

2026-02-16 14:00:18.447230,Divorce Petition,"As a Senior Advocate of the Kerala High Court, I understand the gravity and sensitivity involved in drafting a divorce petition. The accuracy, legal precision, and clarity of such a document are paramount.

Given the instructions, I will draft a formal Divorce Petition for The Family Court at Alappuzha, Kerala, adhering to the specified rules, particularly regarding the use of ""PARTY A"" and ""PARTY B"" and the omission of specific names or addresses.

**Crucially, the prompt states ""FACTS:"". Since no specific facts detailing the grounds for divorce (e.g., cruelty, desertion, adultery, mental illness, etc.) have been provided, I will draft the petition with placeholder paragraphs for these essential details. As a Senior Advocate, I would unequivocally advise that these paragraphs must be filled with specific, detailed, and verifiable instances, dates, and particulars as provided by the client (PARTY A) to form a robust legal basis for the petition.**

I will assume, for the purpose of this draft, that the parties are governed by the **Hindu Marriage Act, 1955**, as it is one of the most common statutes for divorce in India. If the parties belong to another religion (Christian, Muslim, Parsi) or were married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the specific statutory provisions and grounds would need to be adjusted accordingly.

**(Accused)**

---

**COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 138 READ WITH SECTION 142 OF THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881**

The Complainant above named respectfully submits as follows:

1.  The Complainant, PARTY A, is an individual engaged in [DESCRIBE COMPLAINANT'S BUSINESS/PROFESSION/ACTIVITY, e.g., 'business of trading goods,' 'money lending,' 'service provider,' etc.], residing and carrying on business within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.
2.  The Accused, PARTY B, is also an individual residing and carrying on business within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, known to the Complainant for a considerable period.
3.  The Complainant submits that the Accused had approached the Complainant for a financial accommodation/transaction/goods supply/service rendering, and in discharge of a legally enforceable debt/liability arising therefrom, the Accused had issued a cheque to the Complainant.
4.  In specific, the Accused issued Cheque No. **[CHEQUE NUMBER]**, dated **[DATE OF CHEQUE, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]**, for an amount of **Rs. [AMOUNT IN FIGURES]/- (Rupees [AMOUNT IN WORDS] Only)**, drawn on his/her bank account bearing No. [ACCOUNT NUMBER (OPTIONAL)] with **[BANK NAME AND BRANCH OF ACCUSED, e.g., State Bank of India, Alappuzha Branch]**.
5.  The said cheque was issued by the Accused with the assurance that it would be honoured upon presentation. Relying on this assurance, the Complainant presented the said cheque for encashment through his/her banker, **[COMPLAINANT'S BANK NAME AND BRANCH, e.g., Canara Bank, Alappuzha Branch]**, on **[DATE OF PRESENTATION, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]**.
6.  However, to the utter shock and dismay of the Complainant, the said cheque was returned unpaid/dishonoured by the Complainant's banker on **[DATE OF RETURN MEMO, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]** with the endorsement **""FUNDS INSUFFICIENT""** (or specify the exact reason as per memo, e.g., ""Account Closed"", ""Stop Payment by Drawer"") vide Cheque Return Memo No. **[MEMO NUMBER]** issued by **[ACCUSED'S BANK NAME AND BRANCH]**.
7.  Upon receipt of the intimation of dishonour, the Complainant caused a statutory legal notice dated **[DATE OF LEGAL NOTICE, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]** to be issued to the Accused through his/her counsel, demanding payment of the cheque amount. The said notice was sent through Registered Post with Acknowledgment Due (RPAD) on **[DATE OF POSTING, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]**, bearing postal receipt No. **[POSTAL RECEIPT NUMBER]**, to the correct residential/business address of the Accused.
8.  The said legal notice was duly served upon/received by the Accused on **[DATE OF RECEIPT, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY]** (or, 'was returned with the endorsement ""refused"" or ""left without address"" on [DATE OF RETURN], thereby constituting deemed service as per law').
9.  Despite due service of the notice, the Accused failed to make payment of the cheque amount within the stipulated period of fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the notice, nor has he/she paid the amount thereafter to date.
10. Thus, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, as the cheque was issued for a legally enforceable debt/liability, it was dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds, and the Accused failed to make payment within the statutory period after receiving the demand notice.
11. The cause of action for this complaint arose within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, as the cheque was drawn on a bank in Alappuzha, the Complainant's bank is situated at Alappuzha, the legal notice was issued from Alappuzha, and the Accused resides/carries on business within the limits of this Hon'ble Court.
12. The Complainant has not filed any other complaint or proceeding against the Accused on the same set of facts.
13. Necessary court fees have been paid as required by law.

**PRAYER**

In the light of the above facts and circumstances, the Complainant most humbly prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a) Take cognizance of the offence committed by the Accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
b) Issue summons/warrant against the Accused, PARTY B.
c) Try and punish the Accused, PARTY B, in accordance with law.
d) Direct the Accused to pay the cheque amount of **Rs. [AMOUNT IN FIGURES]/-** along with interest and compensation to the Complainant as deemed fit by this Hon'ble Court.
e) Award costs of this proceeding to the Complainant.
f) Grant any other further relief or reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.

2.  Any other witness deemed necessary during trial (e.g., Bank Official for Cheque Return Memo, Postal Department Official for service of notice if disputed).

**PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE**
**(Under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955)**

The Petitioner most respectfully submits as follows:

1.  That the Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as ""PARTY A"") is a Hindu by religion and permanent resident of the address mentioned above. The Respondent (hereinafter referred to as ""PARTY B"") is also a Hindu by religion and resides at the address mentioned above.

2.  That the marriage between PARTY A and PARTY B was solemnized on **[DATE OF MARRIAGE]** at **[PLACE OF MARRIAGE]** according to Hindu rites and ceremonies. The said marriage was subsequently registered under the provisions of the Kerala Registration of Marriages (Common) Rules, 2008, on **[DATE OF REGISTRATION]**, vide Registration No. **[REGISTRATION NUMBER]** (if applicable, otherwise state ""not registered""). A copy of the Marriage Certificate/Marriage Invitation Card is produced herewith and marked as Annexure A1.

3.  That after the solemnization of the marriage, PARTY A and PARTY B cohabited as husband and wife at **[ADDRESS WHERE THEY LAST RESIDED TOGETHER, e.g., PARTY B's ancestral home/rental accommodation in Idukki]**.

4.  That there are no issues born out of the wedlock between PARTY A and PARTY B (or, if there are issues, state: ""There are [NUMBER] issues born out of the wedlock, namely [NAME(S) OF CHILD/CHILDREN], aged [AGE(S)], whose particulars are not directly relevant to this petition for divorce on grounds of cruelty alone. Their welfare and custody, if required, shall be addressed in separate proceedings or by mutual agreement."").

5.  That this Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present petition as the marriage was solemnized at [PLACE OF MARRIAGE, if within Idukki District], and/or the parties last resided together within the territorial limits of this Court at [ADDRESS], and/or the Respondent resides within the territorial limits of this Court.

6.  That PARTY A submits that PARTY B has treated PARTY A with cruelty after the solemnization of the marriage, rendering it impossible for PARTY A to continue living with PARTY B. The specific instances of cruelty committed by PARTY B against PARTY A, which constitute a reasonable apprehension in the mind of PARTY A that it will be harmful or injurious for PARTY A to live with PARTY B, are inter alia as follows:

    (a) **Verbal and Emotional Abuse:** From the initial days of the marriage, PARTY B subjected PARTY A to constant verbal abuse, disparaging remarks, and public humiliation. PARTY B would routinely criticize PARTY A's appearance, intelligence, family, and upbringing, often in the presence of family members, friends, or even strangers. This constant belittling created a hostile and emotionally draining environment for PARTY A.

    (b) **Isolation and Control:** PARTY B systematically isolated PARTY A from PARTY A's friends and family. PARTY B would discourage PARTY A from visiting PARTY A's parental home, restrict phone calls, and question PARTY A's loyalty whenever PARTY A expressed a desire to connect with loved ones. This controlling behaviour led to immense mental distress and loneliness for PARTY A.

    (c) **Neglect and Indifference:** PARTY B exhibited severe emotional indifference and neglect towards PARTY A. Despite repeated attempts by PARTY A to communicate and resolve issues, PARTY B remained aloof, unresponsive, and often refused to engage in any meaningful conversation, leaving PARTY A feeling abandoned and emotionally unsupported.

    (d) **Financial Cruelty:** PARTY B, despite being gainfully employed, consistently withheld financial support from PARTY A. PARTY B would scrutinize every expense, accuse PARTY A of extravagance, and often refused to provide funds even for basic necessities, forcing PARTY A to rely on their own meager income or family for support, leading to immense stress and embarrassment.

    (e) **False Accusations and Suspicion:** PARTY B harboured unwarranted suspicions about PARTY A's character and fidelity. PARTY B would make baseless accusations, question PARTY A's movements, and constantly demand explanations for trivial matters, thereby fostering an atmosphere of distrust and eroding the very foundation of the marriage.

    (f) **Threats and Intimidation:** On several occasions, when PARTY A attempted to discuss these issues or express their unhappiness, PARTY B resorted to threats, including threatening to harm PARTY A's reputation or to make PARTY A's life miserable, causing immense fear and mental agony.

    (g) **Impact on Health:** The cumulative effect of PARTY B's cruel behaviour led to a severe deterioration of PARTY A's mental and physical health. PARTY A suffered from [mention general symptoms like severe anxiety, depression, insomnia, loss of appetite, etc.], requiring medical consultation.

7.  That despite repeated attempts by PARTY A to make the marriage work, including counselling sessions (if any, mention date and details, otherwise state ""personal appeals and attempts at reconciliation""), PARTY B showed no genuine interest in changing their behaviour or rectifying the situation. The marital bond has been irretrievably broken down due to the consistent and severe cruelty perpetrated by PARTY B.

8.  That PARTY A has been living separately from PARTY B since **[DATE OF SEPARATION]**, as the cruelty meted out by PARTY B became unbearable and living together became intolerable and detrimental to PARTY A's well-being.

9.  That there is no collusion between PARTY A and PARTY B in presenting this petition.

10. That there has been no unnecessary or improper delay in instituting this petition.

11. That there have been no previous proceedings in any Court with respect to the marriage between PARTY A and PARTY B (or state particulars of any previous proceedings like M.C. for maintenance, O.P. for restitution of conjugal rights, etc., and their outcome).

12. That for the purpose of Court fees and jurisdiction, the subject matter of the petition is valued at Rs. [NOMINAL VALUE, e.g., 1,000/-] on which the requisite Court fee has been paid.

**PRAYER**

In the premises aforesaid, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to pass a Decree of Divorce:

(a) Dissolving the marriage solemnized between PARTY A and PARTY B on **[DATE OF MARRIAGE]** by a decree of divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
(b) Awarding the costs of this petition to PARTY A.
(c) Granting such other and further reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice and equity.

---

**COMPLAINT UNDER SECTION 138 READ WITH SECTION 142 OF THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881.**

The Complainant above named respectfully submits as follows:

1.  The Complainant is an individual residing within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and is engaged in [COMPLAINANT'S PROFESSION/BUSINESS]. The Accused is also an individual residing within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court and is known to the Complainant.

2.  The Complainant states that the Accused had approached him for a financial accommodation/loan for [STATE PURPOSE OF LOAN, e.g., business requirements/personal expenses] and the Complainant, out of goodwill and trust, advanced a sum of money amounting to Rs. [CHEQUE AMOUNT]/- (Rupees [CHEQUE AMOUNT IN WORDS] Only) to the Accused on [DATE OF LOAN TRANSACTION]. This amount constituted a legally enforceable debt/liability owed by the Accused to the Complainant.

3.  In discharge of the aforesaid legally enforceable debt/liability, and towards repayment of the said loan, the Accused issued a cheque bearing No. [CHEQUE NUMBER], dated [DATE OF CHEQUE] for an amount of Rs. [CHEQUE AMOUNT]/- (Rupees [CHEQUE AMOUNT IN WORDS] Only) drawn on [BANK NAME], [BANK BRANCH] Branch, Alappuzha, Kerala, in favour of the Complainant. The Accused explicitly assured the Complainant that the cheque would be honoured upon presentation.

4.  Pursuant to the assurance given by the Accused, the Complainant presented the said cheque for encashment through his banker, [COMPLAINANT'S BANK NAME], [COMPLAINANT'S BANK BRANCH] Branch, on [DATE OF PRESENTATION], which was well within its period of validity.

5.  However, to the utter dismay and shock of the Complainant, the said cheque was returned unpaid by the Accused's bank vide banker's memo dated [DATE OF RETURN MEMO] with the explicit endorsement ""FUNDS INSUFFICIENT"". This clearly indicated that the Accused did not have adequate funds in his account to honour the cheque at the time of presentation.

6.  Upon receipt of the intimation of dishonour, the Complainant caused a statutory demand notice dated [DATE OF NOTICE] to be issued to the Accused, demanding payment of the cheque amount. The said notice was issued strictly in compliance with the provisions of Section 138, Proviso (b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

7.  The said demand notice was duly dispatched by Registered Post A.D./Courier to the correct and last known address of the Accused on [DATE OF DISPATCH] and was duly served upon the Accused on [DATE OF SERVICE] (as evidenced by the postal acknowledgment card/delivery report).

8.  Despite due service of the demand notice, the Accused has failed to make payment of the cheque amount within the statutory period of fifteen days from the date of receipt of the notice, nor has he offered any valid explanation or responded to the same. The fifteen-day period for payment expired on [DATE - 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF SERVICE].

9.  The failure of the Accused to make payment of the cheque amount within the stipulated period, after having received the demand notice, constitutes an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

10. The cause of action for the present complaint arose on [DATE - 16th DAY AFTER NOTICE SERVICE], upon the expiry of the statutory period for payment by the Accused. The present complaint is filed within the statutory period of thirty days from the date of expiry of the said fifteen-day period, rendering it within the limitation prescribed by Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

11. This Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present complaint as the cheque was issued in Alappuzha, the demand notice was sent from Alappuzha, the Complainant resides in Alappuzha, and the Accused resides within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.

**LIST OF DOCUMENTS RELIED UPON:**

1.  Original Cheque No. [CHEQUE NUMBER] dated [DATE OF CHEQUE] for Rs. [CHEQUE AMOUNT]/-.
2.  Original Bank Return Memo dated [DATE OF RETURN MEMO].
3.  Copy of Statutory Demand Notice dated [DATE OF NOTICE].
4.  Original Postal Receipt No. [RECEIPT NUMBER] dated [DATE OF DISPATCH] for dispatch of notice.
5.  Original Postal Acknowledgment Card/Delivery Report dated [DATE OF SERVICE].
6.  [ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENT, e.g., agreement for loan if applicable, though not strictly mandatory for a 138 complaint].

**LIST OF WITNESSES:**

1.  PARTY A (Complainant)
2.  [Relevant Bank Official, if deemed necessary for proving dishonour, though memo is generally sufficient].

**PRAYER:**

WHEREFORE, the Complainant most humbly prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a)  Take cognizance of the offence committed by the Accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
b)  Issue summons to the Accused.
c)  Try and convict the Accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

e)  Direct the Accused to pay compensation to the Complainant as provided under the Act.
f)  Award costs of this proceeding to the Complainant.
g)  Pass any other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice.

**VERIFICATION**

I, PARTY A, S/o. [FATHER'S NAME], aged about [AGE] years, the Complainant herein, do hereby solemnly affirm and state on oath that the contents of the above complaint from Paragraph 1 to 11 are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, belief, and information, and that nothing material has been concealed therefrom.

#### **PETITION UNDER SECTION 13(1)(ia) OF THE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955, FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE.**

The Petitioner, above named, most respectfully submits as follows:

1.  The Petitioner and the Respondent are Hindus by religion and their marriage was solemnized on **[Date Placeholder, e.g., ""a date in a specific year""]** at **[Place Placeholder, e.g., ""a temple or convention centre in Kollam""]** according to Hindu rites and customs observed by their community. The said marriage was duly registered as per relevant provisions. A copy of the Marriage Certificate, if available, shall be produced at the time of evidence.

2.  After the solemnization of the marriage, the Petitioner and the Respondent cohabited as husband and wife at **[Initial Place of Cohabitation Placeholder, e.g., ""the matrimonial home in Kollam""]**.

3.  No children have been born out of the wedlock between the Petitioner and the Respondent.

4.  From the very initial days of the marriage, the Respondent exhibited a consistently cruel and abusive pattern of behaviour towards the Petitioner, making her matrimonial life unbearable and fraught with constant fear and distress. The Petitioner lived in a perpetual state of mental agony and emotional turmoil.

5.  The acts of cruelty and abuse perpetuated by the Respondent include, but are not limited to, the following:
    a.  **Verbal Abuse:** The Respondent frequently subjected the Petitioner to humiliating and demeaning verbal abuse, often in front of family members and even strangers. This included constant taunts, insults about her physical appearance, intelligence, and family background, and character assassination. He would use extremely foul and derogatory language, causing severe emotional distress and eroding the Petitioner's self-esteem.
    b.  **Emotional and Psychological Abuse:** The Respondent systematically engaged in emotional manipulation and gaslighting. He would deny events, twist facts, and constantly blame the Petitioner for his own shortcomings and aggressive behaviour. He isolated the Petitioner from her family and friends, restricting her social interactions and constantly monitoring her phone calls and movements. The Respondent frequently threatened the Petitioner with dire consequences if she dared to speak about his behaviour or sought help.
    c.  **Financial Exploitation and Control:** The Respondent exhibited extreme possessiveness and control over the Petitioner's personal finances, despite her independent income. He would constantly demand money from the Petitioner, interrogate her about her expenditures, and often withheld basic necessities or funds for household expenses, forcing the Petitioner to bear all financial burdens. This financial abuse added immense stress and humiliation.
    d.  **Unprovoked Outbursts and Intimidation:** The Respondent had frequent and unprovoked outbursts of anger, during which he would scream, throw objects, and make threatening gestures towards the Petitioner. Though not always physically violent, the constant threat of physical harm and the atmosphere of fear created by his unpredictable rage was a grave form of cruelty.
    e.  **Disrespect Towards Petitioner's Family:** The Respondent repeatedly insulted and disrespected the Petitioner's parents and siblings, making disparaging remarks about their financial status and social standing. This caused immense distress to the Petitioner, who deeply values her family.

6.  The cumulative effect of the Respondent's cruel and abusive conduct has completely destroyed the matrimonial bond. The Petitioner's mental and physical health has significantly deteriorated due to the constant stress, anxiety, and fear. She has been diagnosed with stress-related conditions by medical professionals. It has become impossible for the Petitioner to live with the Respondent with any semblance of dignity or peace.

7.  The Petitioner, along with her family members, made several sincere attempts to counsel the Respondent and persuade him to change his behaviour, but all efforts were futile. The Respondent remained unrepentant and continued his abusive conduct without any remorse.

8.  Due to the Respondent's persistent cruelty and the intolerable living conditions, the Petitioner was compelled to leave the matrimonial home on or about **[Date Placeholder, e.g., ""a specific date in a recent year""]**, and has since been residing separately from the Respondent. The marital relationship has broken down irretrievably and there is no hope of reconciliation.

9.  The cause of action for the present petition arose on various dates when the Respondent committed acts of cruelty and abuse, specifically on **[Date Placeholder, e.g., ""the date of separation""]** when the Petitioner was forced to leave the matrimonial home, and continues to subsist.

10. This Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try this petition as the marriage was solemnized within its territorial limits, the parties last resided together within its jurisdiction, and the Petitioner currently resides within its territorial limits.

11. There is no collusion between the Petitioner and the Respondent in presenting this petition.

12. The Petitioner has not presented this petition unnecessarily or improperly delayed in its institution.

13. For the purpose of jurisdiction and court fee, the petition is valued at a nominal amount of Rs. 1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand Only) and the necessary court fee has been affixed herewith.

**PRAYER**

In the light of the facts and circumstances stated above, the Petitioner most humbly prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a)  Pass a decree of divorce dissolving the marriage solemnized between the Petitioner and the Respondent on **[Date Placeholder]** by a decree of divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
b)  Grant costs of these proceedings to the Petitioner.
c)  Grant any other relief or reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in the interests of justice and equity.

She now seeks protection orders, residence orders, monetary reliefs, custody of children, and compensation for the harm suffered.

---

**THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE ABOVE-NAMED PETITIONER MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH:**

1.  The Petitioner is Smt. Priya Gopakumar, aged 32 years, and the aggrieved person in this case. The Respondent No.1 is her husband, Sri. Rajeev R. Pillai, aged 38 years. The Respondent No.2 is the mother-in-law of the Petitioner, Smt. Leela Pillai, aged 65 years. All parties are permanent residents of Alappuzha District.

2.  The marriage between the Petitioner and Respondent No.1 was solemnized on 15.05.2016, as per Hindu rites and customs, at Sree Krishna Swamy Temple, Ambalappuzha. After the marriage, the Petitioner started residing with Respondent No.1 in their marital home, ""Prasanthi Bhavan,"" at Kuttanad P.O., Alappuzha, along with Respondent No.2.

3.  Out of the wedlock, two minor children were born:
    a) Master Arjun Rajeev, aged 6 years (born on 02.01.2018).
    b) Kumari Parvathy Rajeev, aged 3 years (born on 15.09.2021).
    Both children are currently residing with the Petitioner at her parental home.

4.  **FACTS CONSTITUTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE:**
    a) **Economic Abuse and Dowry Harassment:**
        i. Immediately after the marriage, Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.2 began to harass the Petitioner by demanding additional dowry and money, despite her parents having given 75 sovereigns of gold ornaments and ₹10 lakhs cash as 'streedhanam' during the marriage. They constantly taunted her, stating that the dowry was insufficient compared to what other brides brought.
        ii. The Petitioner, who was working as a school teacher earning a salary of ₹30,000/- per month, was forced by Respondent No.1 to quit her job, claiming that it was 'beneath their family's status.' This left her financially dependent on Respondent No.1.
        iii. Subsequently, Respondent No.1 refused to provide adequate money for household expenses, children’s schooling, or the Petitioner's personal needs. He would often confiscate any money given to the Petitioner by her parents, claiming it was his right. He squandered a significant portion of his own earnings on alcohol and gambling, leaving the family in financial distress.
        iv. On multiple occasions, Respondent No.1 forcefully took the Petitioner's personal gold ornaments, including her mangalsutra and bangles, pledging them for his personal debts without her consent or knowledge, and has not returned them till date. The value of these ornaments is approximately ₹5,00,000/-.

    b) **Verbal and Emotional Abuse:**
        i. Respondent No.1 frequently came home in an inebriated state, using abusive and vulgar language towards the Petitioner. He would constantly belittle her, criticize her appearance, cooking, and upbringing, often comparing her negatively to other women.
        ii. Respondent No.2 actively instigated Respondent No.1, often telling him that the Petitioner was disrespectful, lazy, and not a 'good wife.' She would join Respondent No.1 in taunting the Petitioner about her inability to bear a male child, even after the birth of two healthy children.
        iii. The Petitioner was systematically isolated from her natal family. The Respondents severely restricted her communication with her parents and siblings, scrutinizing her phone calls and not allowing her to visit her parental home frequently, even during festivals or family emergencies.
        iv. The children often witnessed these arguments and the abuse hurled at their mother, which has caused them significant emotional distress and trauma.

    c) **Physical Abuse:**
        i. The abuse escalated from verbal to physical violence, especially when Respondent No.1 was under the influence of alcohol. On or around October 2022, Respondent No.1, in a fit of rage, slapped the Petitioner multiple times, leaving bruises on her face, because she questioned him about his late return home.
        ii. In January 2024, during an argument about household expenses, Respondent No.1 pushed the Petitioner against a wall, causing her to fall and sustain minor injuries to her hand and back. Respondent No.2, who was present, did not intervene but rather blamed the Petitioner for ""provoking"" her son.
        iii. On 08.03.2024, after another argument over the Petitioner asking for money for the children's school fees, Respondent No.1 physically assaulted her, kicking her on the leg and threatening to throw her out of the house permanently. He snatched her mobile phone to prevent her from contacting her parents. This incident occurred in front of the minor children, causing them immense fear.

    d) **Threats and Intimidation:**
        i. Respondent No.1 frequently threatened to commit suicide and implicate the Petitioner in false cases if she ever dared to leave him or report his actions to anyone.
        ii. He also threatened to take away the children and prevent her from ever seeing them again, causing the Petitioner immense fear and anxiety.

5.  The cumulative effect of the aforesaid acts of domestic violence caused immense physical pain, mental agony, emotional distress, and financial hardship to the Petitioner and her minor children. The Petitioner continuously lived in a state of fear and apprehension for her safety and that of her children.

6.  On 09.03.2024, after the severe physical assault and threats mentioned above, the Petitioner, fearing for her life and the safety of her children, managed to contact her parents.

**PETITION UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT, 2005, READ WITH OTHER RELEVANT PROVISIONS, SEEKING VARIOUS RELIEFS**

The Petitioner most respectfully showeth:

1.  The Petitioner, RAM, is the legally wedded wife of the Respondent, SHYAM. Their marriage was solemnized on [Date of Marriage, e.g., 15th May 2010] at [Place of Marriage] according to [Customs/Rites, e.g., Hindu religious rites/Christian rites/Muslim rites].

2.  Subsequent to their marriage, RAM and SHYAM resided together in a shared household at [Address of Shared Household] for a period of approximately [Number] years, thereby establishing a domestic relationship as defined under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""). There are [Number, e.g., two] children born out of the said wedlock, namely [Name of Child 1, Age] and [Name of Child 2, Age], who are currently in the custody of RAM / residing with SHYAM (state clearly).

3.  Initially, the marital life of RAM and SHYAM was peaceful for a short period. However, after a few months/years of marriage, SHYAM's behaviour towards RAM changed drastically. He started subjecting RAM to various forms of domestic violence, including physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse, which intensified over time.

4.  **DETAILS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE:**
    The acts of domestic violence committed by SHYAM against RAM include, but are not limited to, the following:

    a.  **Physical Abuse:** SHYAM has repeatedly subjected RAM to physical assaults. For instance, on or about [Specific Date, e.g., 10/03/2022], SHYAM, in a fit of rage, physically assaulted RAM by [describe act, e.g., slapping her hard across the face, pushing her against a wall, kicking her], causing [describe injury, e.g., bruises on her arm, swelling on her cheek, severe pain]. Similar incidents of physical violence occurred on numerous occasions, often after SHYAM consumed alcohol, leaving RAM in constant fear for her safety and well-being. [Mention if medical treatment was sought or police complaint filed, if any].

    b.  **Verbal and Emotional Abuse:** SHYAM habitually used foul language and derogatory terms to abuse RAM. He would constantly demean her, insult her appearance, intelligence, and family, often in front of their children and relatives. He threatened to abandon her, divorce her, and take away the children. This continuous emotional and psychological torture has severely impacted RAM's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and a complete loss of self-esteem.

    c.  **Economic Abuse:** Despite being gainfully employed as a [Profession/Job of SHYAM, e.g., government employee, businessman, private sector employee] and earning approximately Rs. [Monthly Income of SHYAM] per month, SHYAM consistently withheld money from RAM. He refused to provide sufficient funds for household expenses, the children's education, or their medical needs. He confiscated any personal earnings of RAM and denied her access to joint bank accounts, leaving her financially dependent and vulnerable. RAM has no independent source of income and is entirely reliant on SHYAM or her parents for sustenance.

    d.  **Threats and Intimidation:** SHYAM frequently threatened RAM with further violence, prevented her from meeting her family and friends, and isolated her from external support systems. He constantly monitored her phone calls and movements, creating an atmosphere of fear and control within the shared household.

5.  The violence culminated in a grave incident on or about [Most Recent Date of Incident, e.g., 05/06/2024], when SHYAM [describe the most severe or recent incident in detail, e.g., violently assaulted RAM, locked her out of the house, threatened her with a weapon]. Following this incident, RAM was forced to leave the shared household / was thrown out of the shared household / feared for her life and sought refuge at her parental home at [Address where RAM is currently residing].

6.  RAM has made several attempts, through family elders and well-wishers, to resolve the marital discord and bring about a change in SHYAM's abusive behaviour. However, all such efforts have been futile as SHYAM remains unrepentant and continues to harass RAM.

7.  RAM is currently residing at her parental home at [Address] and is entirely dependent on her [parents/relatives] for her basic needs and the upbringing of the children. She is in dire need of financial assistance for her day-to-day expenses, medical care, and the children's education and well-being.

8.  The acts of violence committed by SHYAM fall squarely within the definition of 'domestic violence' under Section 3 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

9.  This Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try this petition as RAM, the aggrieved person, currently resides within the territorial limits of this Court's jurisdiction / the cause of action for this petition has arisen within the territorial limits of this Court's jurisdiction.

**GROUNDS FOR RELIEF:**

a.  The Petitioner, RAM, has been subjected to continuous and severe physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse by the Respondent, SHYAM.
b.  There is an imminent threat to the life and safety of RAM and the children if SHYAM's violent behaviour is not restrained.
c.  RAM has been dispossessed from her shared household and is in dire need of a safe residence.
d.  SHYAM has willfully neglected to maintain RAM and their children, despite having sufficient means to do so.
e.  RAM has suffered immense physical injury, mental torture, emotional distress, and financial loss due to the respondent's acts of domestic violence.

**PRAYER**

In the light of the facts and circumstances stated above, it is most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a.  **Pass a Protection Order under Section 18 of the Act,** restraining SHYAM from committing any further acts of domestic violence, including but not limited to:
    i.  Committing any act of physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, or economic abuse against RAM or the children.

    iii. Attempting to communicate with RAM, directly or indirectly.

    ii. Provide suitable alternative accommodation for RAM and the children, of the same standard as enjoyed in the shared household, and to pay the rent for such accommodation.

c.  **Pass an Order for Monetary Relief under Section 20 of the Act,** directing SHYAM to pay a monthly sum of Rs. [Specify Amount, e.g., 25,000/-] to RAM as maintenance for her and the children, including expenses for food, clothing, medical treatment, children's education, and other necessary expenses, with effect from the date of filing of this petition.

**PETITION FILED UNDER SECTION 13(1)(ia) OF THE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955 (OR RELEVANT PROVISION OF THE APPLICABLE MARRIAGE ACT, E.G., INDIAN DIVORCE ACT, SPECIAL MARRIAGE ACT, ETC.) FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE.**

The Petitioner most respectfully submits as follows:

1.  That AAA and BBBB were lawfully married as per [HINDU/CHRISTIAN/MUSLIM/SPECIAL MARRIAGE ACT] rites and customs on [DATE OF MARRIAGE] at [PLACE OF MARRIAGE]. The marriage was duly solemnized and registered/performed according to the prevailing customs and traditions. A copy of the Marriage Certificate/relevant document is produced herewith and marked as Annexure A1.

2.  That after the said marriage, AAA and BBBB cohabited as husband and wife at [INITIAL MATRIMONIAL HOME ADDRESS] and thereafter at [SUBSEQUENT MATRIMONIAL HOME ADDRESS, IF ANY].

3.  That there [ARE NO CHILDREN / IS ONE CHILD NAMED [CHILD'S NAME, IF ANY] / ARE TWO CHILDREN NAMED [CHILD 1 NAME] and [CHILD 2 NAME]] born out of the wedlock, aged [CHILD'S AGE(S)] respectively. *(If no children, state ""That there are no children born out of the said wedlock."")*

4.  That initially, the marital life of AAA and BBBB was seemingly harmonious. However, soon after the marriage, the true colours of BBBB began to emerge, and AAA was subjected to various forms of abuse and cruelty.

5.  That from approximately [MONTH, YEAR], BBBB started exhibiting a pattern of abusive behaviour towards AAA. This included, but was not limited to, severe verbal abuse, mental torture, physical assaults, and financial deprivation, which has rendered AAA's life with BBBB completely intolerable and unsafe.

6.  That BBBB would frequently subject AAA to humiliating and demeaning verbal abuse, often in the presence of family members and friends, calling AAA derogatory names, questioning AAA's character, and constantly criticizing AAA's appearance, intelligence, and family. This constant verbal onslaught has severely damaged AAA's self-esteem and mental peace.

7.  That apart from the verbal abuse, BBBB has also committed acts of physical cruelty against AAA on multiple occasions.
    *   **Specific Incident 1:** On or about [DATE/MONTH, YEAR], following a minor disagreement, BBBB physically assaulted AAA by [DESCRIBE PHYSICAL ABUSE, e.g., slapping AAA, pushing AAA against a wall, throwing an object at AAA]. This incident caused [DESCRIBE INJURY/TRAUMA, e.g., bruising, shock, fear]. AAA was forced to [SEEK MEDICAL attention/hide the incident].
    *   **Specific Incident 2:** On another occasion, around [DATE/MONTH, YEAR], BBBB, under the influence of alcohol/for no apparent reason, violently [DESCRIBE PHYSICAL ABUSE, e.g., grabbed AAA by the arm, dragged AAA, threatened AAA with a weapon]. This incident instilled immense fear in AAA, making AAA apprehend danger to life and limb.
    *   *(Include more specific incidents with dates and details as necessary. If there are police complaints, medical reports, or witness statements, refer to them here.)*

8.  That BBBB also exercised extreme financial control over AAA, denying AAA access to necessary funds for personal expenses, medical needs, or even basic necessities, despite BBBB having sufficient means. BBBB would constantly scrutinize AAA's spending, leading to extreme financial stress and dependence, which constitutes another form of severe mental cruelty.

9.  That the continuous and unprovoked abuse, both physical and mental, by BBBB has caused AAA to suffer from severe anxiety, depression, and a complete breakdown of mental and physical health. AAA has been living in a constant state of dread and fear, making it impossible to continue residing with BBBB.

10. That AAA made several attempts to reconcile and resolve the issues with the intervention of family elders and common friends, but BBBB remained adamant, unrepentant, and refused to change BBBB's abusive behaviour. All efforts for reconciliation proved futile.

11. That due to the unbearable cruelty and constant threat to AAA's well-being, AAA was forced to separate from BBBB on [DATE OF SEPARATION] and has been residing separately ever since at [AAA'S CURRENT RESIDENCE, if different from paragraph 1]. There has been no cohabitation between AAA and BBBB since the said date of separation.

12. That the acts of cruelty committed by BBBB are grave and severe enough to make it impossible for AAA to reasonably be expected to live with BBBB, and thus, a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (or relevant applicable statute) has arisen.

13. That there is no collusion or connivance between AAA and BBBB in filing this petition.

14. That the cause of action for the present petition arose on various dates when BBBB committed acts of cruelty, and finally on [DATE OF SEPARATION] when AAA was forced to leave the matrimonial home. The cause of action is continuing.

15. That this Hon'ble Court has the necessary territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try this petition as the marriage was solemnized at [PLACE OF MARRIAGE], AAA and BBBB last resided together at [LAST MATRIMONIAL HOME ADDRESS] within the jurisdiction of this Court, and AAA presently resides within the jurisdiction of this Court.

16. That the requisite court fee has been paid/shall be paid as per the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959.

**PRAYER**

In the light of the facts and circumstances stated above, AAA most respectfully prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a)  Grant a decree of divorce, thereby dissolving the marriage solemnized between AAA and BBBB on [DATE OF MARRIAGE];
b)  Direct BBBB to pay permanent alimony to AAA, considering the financial status, income, and assets of BBBB, as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper;
c)  Direct BBBB to pay interim maintenance/alimony and litigation expenses to AAA during the pendency of this petition;
d)  Grant such other and further reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice.

**Important Notes for Actual Filing:**

1.  **Applicable Act:** Ensure the correct Marriage Act is cited (Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; Indian Divorce Act, 1869 for Christians; Special Marriage Act, 1954; Muslim Personal Law principles through the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, etc.). The grounds for divorce vary slightly, but ""cruelty"" is a common ground across most.
2.  **Specifics:** Replace all bracketed placeholders `[ ]` with accurate information. The more specific details you can provide about the abuse (dates, witnesses, injuries, medical reports, police complaints, messages, etc.), the stronger the petition will be.
3.  **Children:** If there are children, you might need to add prayers for custody, visitation rights, and child maintenance.
4.  **Documents:** Annexures should include the Marriage Certificate, any relevant medical reports, police complaints, or other documentary evidence supporting the claims of abuse.
5.  **Local Practice:** Always consult with a local Kerala advocate for specific court procedures, formatting, and any minor variations in practice.
6.  **""S/o / D/o / W/o""**: Choose the appropriate one. Sometimes, for identification, the father's or husband's name is legally required even if not part of the 'AAA' / 'BBBB' instruction, to uniquely identify the individual in court records.
7.  **Professional Advice:** This is a template. A real case requires thorough client consultation to gather all facts and evidence."

This incident occurred at **[Location - e.g., ""their matrimonial home in the presence of their child/no one""]**.
        *   Subsequently, such physical assaults became a recurring pattern. On various occasions, including **[Date - e.g., ""20.07.2015""]** and **[Date - e.g., ""10.02.2020""]**, DDD subjected CCCC to similar acts of physical violence, often without any provocation, leaving CCCC in extreme physical pain and mental trauma.

    b.  **Verbal and Emotional Abuse:**
        *   DDD habitually subjects CCCC to severe verbal abuse, using derogatory and demeaning language, calling her **[e.g., ""useless,"" ""ugly,"" ""incompetent,"" ""a burden""]**. He constantly criticizes her appearance, her cooking, her parenting skills, and her intelligence.
        *   He repeatedly threatens to **[e.g., ""throw her out of the house,"" ""harm her family members,"" ""commit suicide and blame her""]**.
        *   DDD intentionally isolates CCCC from her friends and family, restricting her communication with them and constantly monitoring her movements. He has often insulted CCCC in front of relatives and friends, causing her immense humiliation and social isolation.
        *   He routinely belittles her aspirations and achievements, creating an environment of emotional suffocation and diminishing her self-worth.

    c.  **Economic Abuse:**
        *   Despite CCCC's need for financial independence, DDD has consistently deprived her of economic resources. He **[e.g., withholds money for household expenses, refuses to provide adequate food or medical care for CCCC and children, forces her to hand over her entire salary if she is employed]**.
        *   He controls all financial decisions without consultation and refuses to provide CCCC with any money for her personal needs or for the maintenance of their children, despite having sufficient means. This has left CCCC entirely dependent on him and vulnerable.

5.  The cumulative effect of these continuous acts of domestic violence has caused CCCC immense physical pain, severe mental agony, emotional distress, and has gravely impacted her psychological well-being. She lives in constant fear for her safety and life, as well as the safety of their children.

6.  CCCC has made several attempts to resolve the issues peacefully and to seek an end to the abuse, involving family elders and friends, but all efforts have been in vain as DDD remains unrepentant and continues his abusive behaviour.

7.  The cause of action for the present petition arose within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, as the parties resided and the acts of domestic violence occurred at [Location within District], within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.

8.  CCCC has not filed any other similar petition against DDD concerning the same subject matter before any other Court.

9.  In light of the aforesaid facts, CCCC is in urgent need of protection and reliefs under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

**PRAYER**

WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a)  Pass a **Protection Order** under Section 18 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, restraining DDD from committing any further acts of domestic violence, threatening, harassing, communicating with, or approaching CCCC, and from alienating any assets, operating bank lockers, or causing any other harm to CCCC.

b)  Pass a **Residence Order** under Section 19 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, directing DDD:
    *   To allow CCCC to reside in the matrimonial home located at [Address of Matrimonial Home], and restraining DDD from dispossessing her from the same;
    *   **OR (if CCCC has left)** To provide suitable alternative accommodation for CCCC and [mention children, if any] of the same or higher standard as the matrimonial home, or to pay rent for such accommodation, the cost of which shall be borne by DDD.

c)  Pass a **Monetary Relief Order** under Section 20 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, directing DDD to pay:
    *   A sum of **Rs. [Amount - e.g., 25,000/-]** (Rupees [Amount in words - e.g., Twenty Five Thousand only]) per month towards maintenance for CCCC and [mention children, if any] to meet their daily expenses, food, clothing, medical and educational needs.
    *   A lump sum compensation of **Rs. [Amount - e.g., 1,00,000/-]** (Rupees [Amount in words - e.g., One Lakh only]) for the damages caused due to loss of earnings and medical expenses incurred by CCCC due to the domestic violence.

d)  Pass a **Custody Order** under Section 21 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, granting temporary custody of the minor children, if any, to CCCC, with necessary arrangements for visitation rights for DDD under the supervision of the Court. *(Omit if no children involved)*

e)  Pass a **Compensation Order** under Section 22 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, directing DDD to pay a sum of **Rs. [Amount - e.g., 5,00,000/-]** (Rupees [Amount in words - e.g., Five Lakhs only]) as compensation for the immense physical and mental injuries, emotional distress, and trauma caused to CCCC by his acts of domestic violence.

f)  Grant any other relief or reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case, to ensure justice to CCCC.

And for this act of kindness, the Petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.

**Note for the User:**
*   **""District Court"" vs. ""Judicial Magistrate of First Class"":** While you mentioned ""District Court,"" applications under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, are typically filed before the Judicial Magistrate of First Class (JMFC) or Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) in metropolitan areas. The JMFC's court is usually located within the District Court complex, which might lead to the informal use of ""District Court."" This draft uses the correct legal designation for the initial filing.
*   **Specificity is Key:** In a real-life scenario, you would need to provide much more specific dates, times, locations, and detailed descriptions of each incident of violence. The more precise the details, the stronger the case.
*   **Medical Records/Evidence:** Any supporting evidence like medical records, police complaints, photographs, call recordings, witness statements, etc., should be listed and annexed to the petition.
*   **Amounts:** The specific amounts for maintenance and compensation are placeholders; they would need to be determined based on the actual financial standing of DDD, the needs of CCCC, and the severity of the violence."

**IN THE COURT OF THE MUNSIFF, KOTTAYAM**

**O.S. NO. ____ OF 2024**

**I.A. NO. ____ OF 2024**

**Between:**

**PARTY A,** aged about [Age] years, son/daughter/wife of [Occupation/Relation], residing at [Residential Address - *as per rental agreement/current residence*], Kottayam District.
*(Plaintiff/Petitioner)*

**VERSUS**

**PETITION FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTION**
**(Under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908)**

The Petitioner most humbly submits as follows:

1.  PARTY A is the Plaintiff in the above Original Suit and PARTY B is the Defendant. The above Original Suit has been filed by PARTY A seeking [briefly state the main relief sought in the O.S., e.g., 'a declaration of tenancy rights and permanent injunction' or 'recovery of advance amount and damages' if the suit is about unlawful eviction without notice].

2.  The subject matter of the dispute pertains to the residential flat bearing Door No. [Flat No., if available] at [Building Name/Complex Name, if available], [Street/Area Name], Kottayam [Pin Code], more fully described in the schedule appended hereto (hereinafter referred to as ""the plaint schedule property"").

3.  PARTY A entered into a valid and subsisting rental agreement with PARTY B concerning the plaint schedule property on [Date of Agreement]. As per the said agreement, PARTY A became a tenant under PARTY B, agreeing to pay a monthly rent of Rs. [Amount]/- (Rupees [Amount in Words] only) and having paid a security deposit of Rs. [Amount]/- (Rupees [Amount in Words] only). A copy of the said rental agreement is produced herewith as Annexure A1.

4.  Pursuant to the said rental agreement, PARTY A was put in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the plaint schedule property on [Date of Commencement of Tenancy] and has been continuously residing therein, paying the monthly rent regularly to PARTY B, in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

5.  Recently, without any justifiable cause or legal notice as per the provisions of the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965 (if applicable, otherwise state 'without due process of law' or 'in violation of the rental agreement'), PARTY B has been illegally attempting to forcibly evict PARTY A from the plaint schedule property. PARTY B has resorted to various coercive and unlawful means, including [mention specific acts if known, e.g., 'threatening PARTY A', 'cutting off essential services like water/electricity', 'attempting to trespass'], thereby disturbing PARTY A's peaceful possession and enjoyment.

6.  PARTY A has a strong prima facie case in his favour, as he is a lawful tenant in peaceful possession of the plaint schedule property under a valid rental agreement. PARTY B has no right to evict PARTY A except by due process of law.

7.  The balance of convenience is also in favour of PARTY A, as PARTY A would be rendered homeless and suffer immense hardship if forcibly evicted, whereas PARTY B would not suffer any prejudice by awaiting the outcome of the suit and following legal procedure.

8.  If the interim injunction sought is not granted, PARTY A will suffer irreparable injury that cannot be compensated in money or otherwise. The illegal and forceful actions of PARTY B would gravely prejudice PARTY A's right to peaceful occupation and enjoyment of the property.

9.  No similar application has been filed or granted in this Hon'ble Court or any other Court in respect of the subject matter of this petition.

10. The necessary court fee has been paid herewith.

**PRAYER**

It is, therefore, most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a) Grant an order of temporary injunction restraining PARTY B, his agents, servants, assigns, or anybody acting on his behalf, from forcibly evicting PARTY A from the plaint schedule property, or from trespassing into the plaint schedule property, or from obstructing PARTY A's peaceful possession and enjoyment of the plaint schedule property, pending the final disposal of the above Original Suit;
b) Award the costs of this application to PARTY A; and
c) Grant such other further reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the interests of justice and equity.

Dated this the ____ day of [Month], 2024.

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THE LAWYER USING THIS DRAFT:**

1.  **Fill in all bracketed information `[ ]`:** Ensure all placeholders are accurately filled with specific details from the actual case.
2.  **Specifics of O.S.:** The injunction application (I.A.) is always *within* an Original Suit (O.S.). Ensure the O.S. has already been filed or is being filed concurrently. The ""briefly state the main relief sought in the O.S."" in para 1 should match your O.S. prayer.
3.  **Legal Basis for Tenancy:** If the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965, applies (i.e., it's a residential building, not exempted, etc.), refer to it where appropriate regarding eviction procedures (e.g., notice requirements, grounds for eviction only through Rent Control Court). If it's a commercial tenancy or exempted building, state ""without due process of law.""
4.  **Evidence:** This petition must be supported by evidence (e.g., rental agreement, rent receipts, communication proving threats, if any). These should be listed as Annexures (e.g., Annexure A1, A2, etc.).
5.  **Service:** Ensure proper notice of the I.A. is served to PARTY B as per rules.
6.  **Court Fees:** Verify and affix the correct court fee stamps as per Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act.
7.  **Flat Description:** The ""Schedule of Property"" must be precise, preferably matching the rental agreement and property documents.
8.  **Age and Relation/Occupation:** While ""No Names"" is strict, usually, an age and a relationship (e.g., S/o [Father's name], W/o [Husband's name]) or occupation is required for identification in court. Since names are forbidden, using ""S/o [Occupation]"" or ""W/o [Occupation]"" might be a workaround if the court requires some more specific descriptor. For this draft, I've kept it as `[Occupation/Relation]` for maximum adherence to ""no names."""
